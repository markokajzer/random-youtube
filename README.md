Get redirected to a random song in your favorite playlist.

I was tired of listening to the same songs within my YouTube playlist over and over again as I was too lazy and just started from the beginning every time. So the first couple of songs became quite boring while I never heard the later ones. This app redirects you to a random entry within your playlist, so you do not have to chose yourself!

Running instance at [randtube.herokuapp.com](http://randtube.herokuapp.com). If you do not specify a parameter, you will listen to my own playlist. But you can use this for your playlist as well if you add `?playlist=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID`. You can find the ID in the URL when navigating to your playlist.
